I am a M.S.E Student in [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/), Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.
My primary research focus lies in the integration of multimodal medical information, and I have recently developed a strong interest in applying Vision Language Models within the field of radiation oncology.

I graduated from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree, advised by [Zhiwei Wang](https://andysis.github.io/)
